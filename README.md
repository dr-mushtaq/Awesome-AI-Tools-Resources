<summary> <h2>🧠 Knowledge Summarization</h2> </summary>
	
| Title/Link | Description |Extra Resources|
|---|---|---|
| [**Notebook LM**](https://notebooklm.google.com/) | NotebookLM remains an easy recommendation! I’ve been a fan since March 2024, and NotebookLM only keeps getting better. Since my last update, NotebookLM introduced interactive mind maps, native source discovery, and multilingual audio podcasts based on your uploads. |[1](https://www.ai-supremacy.com/p/how-to-use-notebooklm-for-personalized)[2](https://excellentprompts.substack.com/p/notebooklm)|
| [**Napkin**](https://napkin.one/) | Visual thinking tool to turn ideas into diagrams.Napkin automatically turns walls of text into catchy visuals like diagrams, infographics, etc. For design-challenged people like myself, it’s a superb way to illustrate concepts with minimal effort. |
| [**Learn About**](https://learning.google.com/experiments/learn-about/signup) |Learn About is another Google product that complements NotebookLM nicely. While NotebookLM is grounded in your preselected sources and synthesizes info across them, Learn About can browse the web and is built for open-ended exploration of any topic. |
| [**Perplexity**](https://www.perplexity.ai/?login-source=oneTapHome&login-new=false) |Perplexity I don’t use Perplexity too often, but its “Pro” search is a good midway point between simple web browsing and the time-intensive “Deep Research” tools. |
| [**Google AI Studio**](https://aistudio.google.com/live?model=gemini-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-dialog) |It’s still crazy to me that Google makes so much available for free via Google AI Studio. You can access its latest frontier models (Gemini 2.5 Pro), image generation, voice generation, coding tools, and live calls with screen or camera sharing. It’s a great way to sample most of what Google has to offer at no charge.. |
